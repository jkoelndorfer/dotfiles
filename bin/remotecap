# This script does a remote wireshark packet capture on a specified interface.
#
# It's fairly simple and exists mostly for example purposes.

hostname="$1"
iface="$2"

# Here, we run tcpdump remotely.
# -s0 prevents packets from being truncated by tcpdump - this is optional.
#
# -i specifies the interface, obviously.
#
# -U is necessary for a good user experience: it makes tcpdump write packets to
# stdout as they come in, rather than batching them up and waiting for its interal
# buffer to fill.
#
# "-w -" is also necessary: it makes tcpdump write to stdout.
#
#
# As for wireshark, "-k" makes it start capturing immediately and "-i -" makes it
# read from stdin.
