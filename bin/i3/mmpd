# mmpd - middle mouse paste disabler
#
# I don't paste using the middle mouse button. Sometimes I click my middle mouse button in
# an application like Slack and it dumps a bunch of garbage out. I don't like that, so here's
# a workaround.
#
# The xclip invocation below will empty the "primary" buffer and keep the process running until:
#
# 1) a selection gets put into the primary buffer, or
# 2) a paste is made from the primary buffer
#
# In either case, it will be immediately relaunched by the shell, thus ensuring the primary
# buffer stays empty.
#
# xclip should not be spawned hundreds of times a second using this method.

    xclip -quiet -selection primary -in -loops 1 </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1
