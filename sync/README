# Cloud Sync Configuration

This directory contains Syncthing setup helpers and configuration so
that application persisted data automatically lands in Syncthing
directories.

We're interested in saved game data in particular so that we have
a versioned, cloud-synced backup. It's a little better than what
Steam provides. :-)

## Quickstart Guide

Run the `setup` script and give it the path to a _sync config_
in order to create the necessary symlinks to point an application's
data directory at a directory managed by Syncthing. For example:

```bash
$ ./setup config/elden-ring
'[...]/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1245620/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Application Data/EldenRing/[...]' -> '[...]/sync/game-saves/elden-ring/save'
```

All done! Elden Ring will now store its read data from and write data to the sync directory.

## Creating a New Sync Config

The most basic sync config contains a `SYNC_DIR` and a `symlink` statement.
Here's an example for Factorio:

```bash
SYNC_DIR='game-saves/factorio'

symlink 'dot-factorio' "${STEAM_HOME}/.factorio"
```

Here, `SYNC_DIR` describes where this application's data lives relative to the
`SYNC_ROOT_DIRECTORY`.

Next is a `symlink` statement, which indicates that a symbolic link should be
created. Here, `${STEAM_HOME}/.factorio` will point at the `dot-factorio` directory
underneath the `SYNC_DIR`.

### Proton Games

Games run via Steam's [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) store their
data in a `compatdata` directory which is nested deeply under `~/.steam`. We have
some helpers to make configuring these a bit easier. Here's an example configuration
for No Man's Sky:

```bash
STEAM_APPID='275850'
SYNC_DIR='game-saves/no-mans-sky'

symlink save "$(proton_steamuser_home)/AppData/Roaming/HelloGames/NMS"
```

Here, `STEAM_APPID` is the unique identifier for the game on Steam. 

The `symlink` statement makes use of shell command substitution to calculate the
home directory of `steamuser` in the game's Wine prefix via the `proton_steamuser_home`
function.

Proton-based games always (or nearly always?) store their data under `$(proton_steamuser_home)`.

You must set `STEAM_APPID` to make use of `$(proton_steamuser_home)`.

## Reference

This section contains reference information for the functionality provided by `setup` and `lib.sh`.

### `SYNC_ROOT_DIRECTORY`

`SYNC_ROOT_DIRECTORY` is the directory under which all Syncthing-managed directories reside.
It *must* be set in the environment when the `setup` script is executed. Set it in shell RC
files (or similar).

Example value: `${HOME}/sync`

### `SYNC_DIR`

`SYNC_DIR` is set in each sync config. It describes where an application's data lives
_relative to_ the `SYNC_ROOT_DIRECTORY`. This value *must* be set in a valid sync config.

Example value: `game-saves/elden-ring`

### `STEAM_APPID`

`STEAM_APPID` is the Steam application ID. This ID is unique to every game on Steam.

You can get it by pulling it from the game's Store page URL or looking the game up
on [steamdb.info](https://steamdb.info). Example: No Man's Sky's, store page URL is
https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/. The app ID, 275850, is
displayed clearly in the URL.

Example value: `275850`

### `symlink`

`symlink` is a function that can be called to configure an application data symlink. A
_useful_ sync config will call this at least once.

Usage: `symlink SYNC_DATA_DIR APPLICATION_DATA_DIR`

`SYNC_DATA_DIR` is the directory _relative to_ `SYNC_DIR` that the created symlink will
point to.

`APPLICATION_DATA_DIR` is the absolute path where the application stores its data. This
directory will be replaced with a symlink that points at `SYNC_DATA_DIR`.

### `proton_steamuser_home`

`proton_steamuser_home` is a helper function that calculates the path to a Proton
application's data directory. You *must* set `STEAM_APPID` in the sync config in
order to use this function.

Example usage: `symlink save "$(proton_steamuser_home)/AppData/Roaming/HelloGames/NMS"`

This function will expand to a path like: `${HOME}/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/${STEAM_APPID}/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser`.
